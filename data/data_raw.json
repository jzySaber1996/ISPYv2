I imported a MobileNet model i trained in Jupyter on some images, and now i successfully imported it in DL4j but when i try to do a prediction on a image i try to load it seems the shape is different than what the model expects as input. So if i provide as input = new NativeImageLoader(224, 224, 3) that translates into a Shape: [1,3,224,224] which does not work. But if i create an input from the model import DL4j docs like input = Nd4j.ones(1, 299, 299, 3) this translates into a Shape: [1,299,299,3] which is accepted by the model. So my question is how could i load an image in DL4j so that it is loaded as [1,224,224,3] instead of [1,3,224,224].emmmmmmmmmm", "issue_label": 1, "solution_label": 0}, {"speaker": "madal3x", "sentence": " ok, i think i found the answer, [<-CODE->] thanksemmmmmmmmmm", "issue_label": 0, "solution_label": 1}], "relations": [[1, 1], [0, 1]]}, {"sentence_samples": [{"speaker": "madal3x", "sentence": " if the loader is NativeImageLoader(224, 224, 3) why would [<-CODE->] return a Shape: [1,3,224,224]. setListeners(#deeplearning4j)e", "issue_label": 1, "solution_label": 0}, {"speaker": "madal3x", "sentence": " is there an irc channel for DL4j?e", "issue_label": 0, "solution_label": 0}, {"speaker": "wmeddie", "sentence": " Chat is a little annoying for the issues you typically get with deep learning.

For example, see - [<-URL->] Even in native typescript, if I explicitly state that a class can have dynamically assigned members, the best I believe I can get back is \"any\" as the type for new dynamically assigned members. TS is really good at inferring types within the class, as long as they are in actual code and not assigned dynamically, so you could maybe get around this if dynamicProp and otherProp are strings out of an allowedPropsName array or something like that. This talks about how types are inferred within classes - [<-URL->].

I have an HttpClient request that can either error on the server, or error on the client if it gets HTTP intercepted when some condition isn't met. Right now, both error.code and error.status are being underlined in red because Property 'code' does not exist on type HttpErrorResponse and Property 'status' does not exist on type ClientError. This is true, neither of those properties exist on their respective classes. However I thought the | pipe would take care of that, and greenlight any properties that exist on either error type.
