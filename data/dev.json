For example, see - [<-URL->] Even in native typescript, if I explicitly state that a class can have dynamically assigned members, the best I believe I can get back is \"any\" as the type for new dynamically assigned members. TS is really good at inferring types within the class, as long as they are in actual code and not assigned dynamically, so you could maybe get around this if dynamicProp and otherProp are strings out of an allowedPropsName array or something like that.

I'm new to Appium and am really struggling to get it working on Mac. We're building our app in Xamarin and exporting the APKs and IPAs from there. I've managed to get it to work on Android on my windows PC, but I can seem to find the right file to build the app on the Mac. The closest I've got is using an IPA which made the splashscreen come onto the screen and disappear 3 times, but I can't get any further than that... Any help would be much appreciated! And just to note - I'm not a developer so please bear with me if I don't understand some of the more technical things. Thanks in advance.
