For example, see - [<-URL->] Even in native typescript, if I explicitly state that a class can have dynamically assigned members, the best I believe I can get back is \"any\" as the type for new dynamically assigned members. TS is really good at inferring types within the class, as long as they are in actual code and not assigned dynamically, so you could maybe get around this if dynamicProp and otherProp are strings out of an allowedPropsName array or something like that. This talks about how types are inferred within classes - [<-URL->].
